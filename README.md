# FreIE
We propose FreIE, an implicit regularization method that enhances mid- and high-frequency signals in the frequency domain. Experiments on seven datasets show that using a frequency domain loss function is optimal. FreIE can reduce the MAE and MSE of various models by an average of 8.1\%.By inserting just 13 lines of FreIE code into the LSTM model, its performance can be elevated to match the state-of-the-art in long-term time series forecasting as of 2021. The code is provided in the supplementary material.
